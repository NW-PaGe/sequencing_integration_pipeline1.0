    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Current Run Schedule:** M, W, F @ 10:00AM  \n",
    "*This script must run prior to the roster compile script on roster days*\n",
    "\n",
    "*What does this script do?* This script accesses the Washington Disease Reporting System (WDRS) to identify records with COVID-19 sequencing information available that need to be added to the sequencing roster. Events reported to WDRS are received via Electronic Laboratory Reporting (ELR), which is an automated process for transmitting health data. The following code extracts new WDRS ENTIRE records from validated ELR submitters (per 3.1.2022: Aegis, Helix, LabCorp, Quest) and transforms the data into the roster format to be added to the WDRS FLATTENED table and included in the sequencing roster.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What is output from this script?*\n",
    "\n",
    "-   write_roster_here: Valid new records are transformed, compiled, and output to the write_roster_here folder for inclusion in the sequencing roster\n",
    "-   For_Review/to_process: Records that are flagged as invalid by the error logic outlined in the quality filters function are output to the Y: Drive For_Review/to_process folder in the manual review format\n",
    "-   Completed_Submissions/ELR: A list of records that were processed (both valid & invalid) are appended to a running list of records that have run through the ELR script – this output is not sent anywhere, just kept as a crude record for deduplication purposes. This is necessary because some erroneous WDRS records are corrected by manually creating a new entry rather than editing the existing one, which forms a small subset of invalid records that exist in the ENTIRE table but never get added to the FLATTENED table. These would be be ingested as “new” entries and generate the same error messages every run if not removed from the roster. We have also had submitters send multiple copies of the same record during the validation process. Having a running list to check against prevents these records from being resubmitted and processed more than once.\n",
    "\n",
    "An email receipt is also generated at the end of each run.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why ELR?* ELR records are parsed from HL7 messages and can be automated and standardized much more readily than piecemeal .csv submissions from individual laboratories, as we see in the Template Submitters script. Ultimately we hope to receive the bulk of our submissions via ELR, as it is a more streamlined process that submits directly to WDRS and therefore does not require matching of patient-level information to WDRS genomic sequencing results – we simply need to identify new records and transform them into the roster format. *Note:* Although ELR is intended to serve as a standardized format, there is still some variation in field use across ELR validated lab submitters. As a result, some components of the current script vary by lab submitter. (This mostly applies to the SEQUENCE ACCESSION and SEQUENCE CLINICAL ACCESSION values.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Developer notes\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is designed to be generalized to WDRS ELR messages and not catered to specific submitters - that way it is easy to quickly ingest records from newly validated submitters. Unless submissions differ dramatically from what we have already encountered, adding a new submitter to the ELR script should be as easy as:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Add the new laboratory to the list of validated ELR submitters in the write_lab_variables.R script and update the lab_vars output object\n",
    "-   Determine the formatting of the SEQUENCE ACCESSION and SEQUENCE CLINICAL ACCESSION variables and update Chunk 9 accordingly - this is the trickiest step\n",
    "-   Add the preferred lab name value when creating the SUBMITTING_LAB variable in Chunk 11\n",
    "-   Update the email message in Chunk 20 to also include the new lab in the output summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Troubleshooting will be required, but *hopefully* the script will require very few changes to add new submitters. This is an important goal because we continue to encourage laboratories to submit via ELR over Template Submissions and hope to process an increasing number of submissions using this script.\n",
