    "**IMPORTANT** the variables used to connect to WDRS are held within conn_list.RDS. All .RDS objects in this repository except for VOC.RDS are excluded from Git commits by declaring \\*.RDS in the .gitignore file because they are often used to hold our “secrets” such as credential and server connections. We do not include server connections in code uploaded to GitHub. **WHY?** We have been asked by HTS to ensure our use of GitHub does not raise any security red flags. This server is an internal server containing confidential/restricted PHI. We want to hide this server information to reduce our possible “attack surface”. This connection may seem benign but it tells someone information they can use to “hack” into WDRS. SQL Server Native Client is now deprecated software and version 11 was the last release. Unsupported software is at higher risk of having security breaches. Additionally, someone would know the server name. **So: DO NOT alter the code used to open the connection to WDRS in any way that creates a security risk. Continue to treat this connection as a secret and store its variables in a .RDS object (or other external object that is excluded from Git commits) rather than calling them directly here.**"
