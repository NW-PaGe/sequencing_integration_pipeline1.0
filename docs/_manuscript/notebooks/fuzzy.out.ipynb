    "The COVID Sequencing project matches lab-submitted COVID test sequencing records with WDRS COVID test result records. Usually this matching process is accomplished by matching clinical accession numbers that are assigned to COVID test specimens by the testing lab and which remain attached to the specimen through the sequencing process. However, some sequencing records are submitted without the clinical accession number, or the clinical accession number that accompanies the sequencing record does not match any COVID test specimen clinical accession in the WDRS Flattened or Entire tables. For sequencing records that cannot match to a test specimen in WDRS via a clinical accession specimen id, patient demographics provide an alternative matching option.\n",

    "The FUZZY_MATCHING script uses `fuzzyjoin::stringdist_left_join()` to perform [optimal string alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance) on patient name and date of birth data to match lab-submitted sequencing data to COVID test specimen records in the WDRS Flattened and Entire tables.\n",

    "Data for fuzzy matching gets sent to the Fuzzy_Match folder in the Submissions subdirectory of the sequencing project. Each run of this script produces a saved_rows.csv file which contains rows that were not printed to any other file during the course of the run. While efforts are made to capture and funnel all of the data to some product in this script, this matching process is complex and saved_rows serves as a safety net to prevent data loss. saved_rows and the new files sent to fuzzy matching from the PHL and TEMPLATE_SUBMITTERS scripts are imported using `readr::read_csv()`, and compiled using `plyr::rbind.fill()`. Base R’s `unique()` removes duplicate rows, which may occur when cumulative files such as the PHL download are run repeatedly through a transformation script before this fuzzy matching process is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Files imported in this code chunk are combined using `plyr::rbind.fill()` because at the time of writing this script, data sent from the template submitters and PHL processes were producing different sets of columns. the `rbind.fill()` function allows for two files with slightly different column to be combined; all the columns will be preserved and blank cells will be added for rows that did not originally contain columns from the other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a part of this data import, a unique row id is assigned using `tibble::rowid_to_column()` to avoid generating duplication events when records lack any unique identifier such as a sequence clinical accession or sequence accession, as sometimes happens when failed sequencing records (which do not require a sequence accession) also lack a sequence clinical accession.\n",
    "\n",
    "**rows_printed**: the empty object rows_printed is created here. Throughout the script, this object will receive the rowid’s of records that are printed to any file. This conveniently allows us to see (if running the script manually) how many rows fall to each of the various output. At the end of the script, any records from the original input data whose rowid is NOT in rows_printed is passed to a saved_rows file which is printed to a subfolder of the fuzzy matches submissions folder and read into the next fuzzy matching session. This file is almost always empty, but it is beneficial to regularly check it to see if and how many records are not being captured by the script. This may indicate some change in the submitter data being received."
