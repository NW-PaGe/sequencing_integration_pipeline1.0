Records are matched on accession number (exact match) and specimen collection date (within a margin of 14 days). Then, entries undergo cleaning, variables of interest are generated, QA checks are performed, and the results are transformed into the sequencing roster format. \n\n*What is output from this script?*\n\n* fuzzy_match: Records that contain demographic information but cannot be matched using clinical accession number are sent to the FUZZY_MATCHING script\n\n* write_roster_here: Valid matched records are compiled and output to the write_roster_here folder for inclusion in the sequencing roster\n\n* For_Review/to_process: Invalid submissions that do not have a sequence status or FAILED or LOW QUALITY are sent to For_Review/to_process folder in the manual review format\n\n* keep_na: Records that meet the criteria for the keep_na process are appended to the existing data object to be reconsidered for matching at a later date\n\n* Completed_Submissions/Template_Submitters/last_run.csv: This is a reference list used internally by this script (i.e. not output to external sources) to document which files were processed in the prior run. Sometimes the final chunk of code fails to delete submission files that are open in the R session. This list is updated at the end of a code run and indicates which files were processed. When the script scans the Submissions folder for new files at the beginning of a code run, it uses this reference list to complete the process of removing those files if any are lingering. Using this approach, no manual action is required to move files. \n\nAt the end of the script, the processed files are moved from their locations within the Submissions folder to the Completed Submissions folder. An email receipt is also generated at this time. \n\n*Note: This process is not an ideal method for receiving records. Ultimately we hope to transition all submitters to electronic laboratory reporting (ELR), which is preferable to receiving piecemeal .csv documents. However, using a template does improve consistency among submitters that have not adopted ELR, which allows us to prepare their records for rostering in a somewhat standardized manner. The incoming .csv files can be subject to formatting or submitter error and sometimes require manual edits before the script can properly ingest them.*\n\n## Developer notes\n\nIn order to process files from a new submitter, a few actions need to be taken to update this script:\n\n1) If a new sender is validated to submit patient-level sequencing information following the template format, *the laboratory name needs to be added to the lab_vars object via the* **write_lab_vars_here.R** *script*. There is a code chunk listing all confirmed template submitters (lab_names_template), and the spelling must match that of the SUBMITTING_LAB column in the submission; simply add the new name to the list! Other scripts beyond this one use that shared object to access the acceptable values for a given field, so making a change in the lab_vars object will populate downstream. \n\n2) If the new sender very rarely submits information, it may be appropriate to drop their new files into the Submissions/adhoc subfolder. If they are regularly sending sequencing data via SFT, a designated sub-folder should be created for that submitter in the Submissions folder. *Make sure code* **Chunk 10** *of this script includes all of the Submissions sub-folders that contribute Template Submissions for ingestion into this script.* (Upon completion of the script, files are moved from their Submissions sub-folder to a corresponding Completed Submissions sub-folder -- this could be created at the same time, but won't be used until later!)\n\n3) Then, examine the format of the GISAID_IDs included in submissions from the new laboratory to determine what modifications should be made to the validation steps in **Chunk 14**. If the GISAID_IDs follow the standard \"^(hCoV-19/)?USA/WA-.*/[[:digit:]]{4}$\" regex pattern, update the list of other submitters to include any new Submissions sub-folders created in the previous step. If the GISAID_IDs do not follow the expected pattern (likely due to a text prefix or unusual number of characters), a new set of code must be written to indicate the typical GISAID_ID format for that submitter for future validation -- this has already been done for Aegis, Helix, and Labcorp, so there is an example to follow! \nIn a related step, **Chunk 17** must be updated to standardize GISAID_IDs for the new submitter if they are partial or do not follow the usual regex pattern. \n\n4) Next, updates need to be made to **Chunk 20** where columns for the final sequencing roster are created. The SEQUENCE_LAB variable is derived from the SUBMITTING_LAB variable included in the submissions. *The variable should be updated to mutate this variable properly for the new submitter.*\nNote that submitters sometimes use different values in the SEQUENCE_LAB column (they're not supposed to, but it happens), but only one value per submitter should be output. This is in part addressed by the code in Chunk 20 using str_detect to identify the lab -- real-life example: str_detect(toupper(SUBMITTING_LAB), \"UW VIROLOGY\") ~ \"UW Virology\" will catch submissions that have been sent with a SUBMITTING_LAB of \"UW Virology\" or \"UW Virology Lab\". Similarly, str_detect(toupper(SUBMITTING_LAB), \"AEGIS\") ~ \"Aegis\" detects submissions from \"Aegis\" or \"Aegis Sciences Corporation\". However, multiple rows may need to be written per submitter if they use acronyms or other names that do not contain shared text -- example: the United States Air Force has sent submissions with the name \"USAFSA\" and \"United States Air Force School of Aerospace\" in the SUBMITTING_LAB column; two lines of code are needed for each variant of the name, but both output the same value to roster: \"USAFSA\". \n\n5) After the script has run, files need to be moved from their sub-folders within the Submissions folder to Completed Submissions. **Chunk 30** contains code to move these files. *The name of any new sub-folders in Submissions and Completed Submissions need to be included here.*\n\nThese steps may not be comprehensive, and files from new submitters may contain their own idiosyncrasies - but this should offer a decent starting place if adding a newly validated laboratory to our suite of template submitters!\n\n# Script setup {.tabset}\n\n## Libraries\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(odbc)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(vroom)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Import objects {.tabset}\n\n## Data objects\n\nThis part of the script calls several data objects that contain information required for this process. \nThe lab_vars object is curated by Sequencing Project script runners and serves as a master reference for validated variable input.
